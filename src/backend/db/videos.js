      "Learn all of the materials involved in sketching and drawing and also some basic shading techniques and sketching concepts. In this video, I start off going through all of the materials you're going to need for learning to sketch and draw. Once you have a better understanding of those, you can start drawing simple shapes and lines and practicing sketching with an HB, B, or 2B pencil. These are good pencils for sketching lightly but also allow you to go a little darker when needed for shading. I plan to cover perspective, values, edges, shading techniques, proportions, landscapes and many other topics of sketching and drawing for beginners and intermediate artists.",
